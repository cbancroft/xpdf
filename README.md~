xpdf
====

Fork of XPDF to allow setting the initial size of the outline pane.

based off of [xpdf 3.03]:http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf/

I work with large PDF documents on a daily basis and I was getting sick of
having to resize the outline pane every time I restarted xpdf.  Since they
stupidly hardcode it to be 175, I took the liberty of adding an xresource to
control it instead.
